                Hi, I'm Faikar!
                </h2>
                <p>
                I'm a Computer Science student in Hunter College with a passion for software engineering. 
                Iâ€™m always happy to join more group projects to sharpen my skills and learn from others. 
                I also teach physics, which keeps me sharp in problem-solving, and write songs as a creative outlet. 
                I'm always open to learn new things in various fields <strong>because as humans we should always strive to learn more!</strong>
