        <h2>Hi, I'm Faikar!</h2>
        <p>
            I've always been interested in a lot of things from physics to drawings so it's really hard for me to focus on one thing. So here are my top 3 things I love.
        </p>  
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div>
                    <strong>1. App Development</strong>
                    <p>
                        They say "<i>if there's a problem, you can create an app for it</i>".
                        There are infinitely many problems in this world and is still increasing at this moment in time, but there are only a finite amount of apps that has been made. I 
                        want to contribute as much as possible by creating apps that are useful for people in need, solving one problem at a time. Not only that, but the process of creating apps
                        is where we can work together and build a community, and I feel that it is one of the most important part about app development. Because it's not just <i>app</i> there is also the <i>development</i> part to it. 
                    </p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    <strong>2. Computer Architecture</strong>
                    <p>
                    Have you heard the term "<i>Computers are just 1's and 0's</i>", I want you to not just take it as it is, I want you to ask yourself, how is that possible. 
                    How does 1's and 0's make the screen you are seeing right now? As a computer science major, I am exposed to many different studies of computers, one such is the study of the architecture of computers and how they are made. Computer architecture
                    truly breaks down to the most basic components the screen you are seeing right now -unraveling the abstraction that is computers-, which I find very fascinating.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div>
                    <strong>3. Music</strong>
                    <p>
                    Music for me is like a canvas, or an empty code editor for all you techies reading this. It serves as an outlet to create or to express how I feel through very absract meaning which are music notes. When you're in too deep debuggin a code for hours on end,
                    it's good to stop and relax. For me music serves that purpose of destressing and letting out my emotion through instrument. Getting out of all the logical stuff and just enjoying playing music. Try it out!
                    </p>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
